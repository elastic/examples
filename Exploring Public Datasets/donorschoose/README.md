## Using Elasticsearch & Kibana to Analyze DonorsChoose.org data

This examples provides supplementary material to the blog post on [Hacking Education with Elastic stack](https://www.elastic.co/blog/hacking-education-with-the-elastic-stack).

In this example, we will be analyzing the historical donations and projects data provided by [DonorsChoose.org](http://data.donorschoose.org/open-data/overview/) using Elasticsearch and Kibana. DonorsChoose.org is an online charity that connect individuals with schools and teachers in need of resources. For additional background on this dataset, please refer to the accompanying [blog post](https://www.elastic.co/blog/hacking-education-with-the-elastic-stack)

##### Version

Example has been tested in following versions:
- Elasticsearch 7.8
- Kibana 7.8

**We recommend atleast 8GB of availble RAM for running ElasticSearch for this example**. The dataset continues to grow and thus the counts indicated might no longer be accurate as of the time of writing - 11/2017.

### Installation & Setup

* Follow the [Installation & Setup Guide](https://github.com/elastic/examples/blob/master/Installation%20and%20Setup.md) to install and test the Elastic Stack (*you can skip this step if you already have a working installation of the Elastic Stack*)

* Update the Elasticsearch default heap size. Modify by editing the file `<elasticsearch root>/config/jvm.options`, updating the following values to 4g:

```
# Xms represents the initial size of total heap space
# Xmx represents the maximum size of total heap space

-Xms4g
-Xmx4g
```

Note: The above assumes you have 8GB of available RAM, setting the Elasticsearch to half of available RAM per recommended best practices.

* Run Elasticsearch & Kibana

  ```shell
  <path_to_elasticsearch_root_dir>/bin/elasticsearch
  <path_to_kibana_root_dir>/bin/kibana
  ```

* Check that Elasticsearch and Kibana are up and running.
  - Open `localhost:9200` in web browser -- should return status code 200
  - Open `localhost:5601` in web browser -- should display Kibana UI.

  **Note:** By default, Elasticsearch runs on port 9200, and Kibana run on ports 5601. If you changed the default ports, change   the above calls to use appropriate ports.

### Download & Ingest Data

You have 2 options to index the data into Elasticsearch. You can either use the Elasticsearch [snapshot and restore](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-snapshots.html) API to directly restore the `donorschoose` index from a snapshot. OR, you can download the raw data from the DonorsChoose.org website and then use the scripts in the [Scripts-Python](https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Exploring%20Public%20Datasets/donorschoose/scripts) folder to process the raw files and index the data.

#### Option 1. Load data by restoring index snapshot
(Learn more about snapshot / restore [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/modules-snapshots.html))

Using this option involves 4 easy steps:

  * Download and uncompress the index snapshot .tar.gz file into a local folder <br>
  **NOTE** - The index snapshot file is ~7.5 GB. Make sure you have a fast internet connection, and enough free space on disk before you download. 
  ```shell
  # Create snapshots directory
  mkdir elastic_donorschoose
  cd elastic_donorschoose
  # Download index snapshot to elastic_donorschoose directory
  wget http://download.elasticsearch.org/demos/donorschoose/donorschoose.tar.gz .
  # Uncompress snapshot file
  tar -xf donorschoose.tar.gz
  ```
  This adds a `donorschoose_backup` subfolder containing the index snapshots.

  * Add `donorschoose_backup` dir to `path.repo` variable in the `elasticsearch.yml` in the `path_to_elasticsearch_root_dir/config/` folder. See example [here.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-snapshots.html#_shared_file_system_repository). Restart elasticsearch for the change to take effect.

  * Register a file system repository for the snapshot *(change the value of the “location” parameter below to the location of your `donorschoose_backup` directory)*
  
      ```shell
      curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/donorschoose_backup' -d '{
          "type": "fs",
          "settings": {
              "location": "<path_to_donorschoose_backup_dir>",
              "compress": true,
              "max_snapshot_bytes_per_sec": "1000mb",
              "max_restore_bytes_per_sec": "1000mb"
          }
      }'
      ```

  * Restore the index data into your Elasticsearch instance:
    ```shell
    curl -XPOST "localhost:9200/_snapshot/donorschoose_backup/snapshot_1/_restore"
    ```

At this point, go make yourself a coffee. When you are done enjoying your cup of delicious coffee, check to see if the restore operation is complete.

#### Option 2: Process and load data using Python script

The raw DonorsChoose.org data is provided as 5 separate files. In order to do some useful querying of the data in a search engine / NoSQL store like Elasticsearch, you typically have to go through a data modeling process of identifying how to join data from various tables. The files and instructions provided in the [scripts](https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Exploring%20Public%20Datasets/donorschoose/scripts) folder provide example of processing, modeling and ingesting data into Elasticsearch starting with the raw data.

We are providing this option in case you want to modify how the data is joined, perform additional data cleansing, enrich with additional data, etc. Follow the [ReadMe](https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Exploring%20Public%20Datasets/donorschoose/scripts/README.md) in the [scripts](https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Exploring%20Public%20Datasets/donorschoose/scripts) folder if you want to try this option.

#### Check data availability
Once the index is created using either of the above options, you can check to see if all the data is available in Elasticsearch. If all goes well, you should get a `count` response of approximately `3506071` when you run the following command.

  ```shell
  curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XGET localhost:9200/donorschoose/_count -d '{
  	"query": {
  		"match_all": {}
  	}
  }'
  ```

#### Visualize Data in Kibana

* Access Kibana by going to `http://localhost:5601` in a web browser
* Connect Kibana to the `donorschoose` index in Elasticsearch
    * Click the **Settings** tab >> **Indices** tab >> **Create New**. Specify `donorschoose` as the index pattern name, select `donation_timestamp` as the **Time-field name**, and click **Create** to define the index pattern.
    * If this is the only index pattern declared, you will also need to select the star in the top upper right to ensure a default is defined. 
* Load sample dashboard into Kibana
    * Click the **Settings** tab >> **Objects** tab >> **Import**, and select `donorschoose_kibana.ndjson`
    * On import you will be asked to overwrite existing objects - select "Yes, overwrite all". Additionally, select the index pattern "donorschoose" when asked to specify a index pattern for the dashboards.
* Open dashboard
    * Click on **Dashboard** tab and open `Donors Choose` dashboard. Voila! You should see the following dashboard. Happy Data Exploration!
